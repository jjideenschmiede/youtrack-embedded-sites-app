# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this project serves as the backend for an application, we are committed to maintaining the security of our platform by ensuring that only the most recent release is supported with security updates. Once a new version is released, it is immediately deployed, rendering the previous version obsolete in a live environment. Therefore, we encourage all users to keep their systems up to date with the latest release to benefit from the latest security enhancements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you notice a security vulnerability, we encourage you to take an active role in our security process by directly creating a pull request with the necessary adjustments to address the issue. This proactive approach helps us ensure that vulnerabilities are swiftly resolved, maintaining the integrity and safety of our project.

When creating a pull request to address a security vulnerability, please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- A step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
- The specific changes you propose to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Any additional information or context that might help in the assessment and resolution of the problem.

This direct method of reporting and resolving security issues facilitates a more efficient and effective response, allowing us to implement security improvements with the help of our community. We appreciate your contributions to making our project more secure.
